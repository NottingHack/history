The <a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/drawdio/' target='_blank'>Drawdio</a> kit is very hackable and a good kit for getting started with soldering. <br /><br /><b>For the Beginne</b>r - <br /><br />We provide the full kit to make and keep and tools (soldering iron, solder and everything else you need to get started) as well as &quot;step-by-step&quot; instructions projected as Matt Little takes you through making the kit. Experienced hackers will be there to help you too. Soldering is great fun and you'll pick-up the basics in no time at all.<br /><br /><b>For the Progressor</b> - <br /><br />Get the kit or buy one of your own. Bring your own tools if you like or share with others. We'll provide printed instruction if you want to rush ahead. Why not hack the kit to make it better. Help beginners by sharing your experience of soldering.<br /><br /><b>For the Pro (Jedi Level)</b> -<br /><br />Share your knowledge and help others learn to solder. The PCB will be available so you don't have to get the kit, use your own components, hack the kit and make it awesome! <br /><br />There are lots of ways to enjoy this hack session and options to suit every level of experience and every pocket too!<br /><br /><b>Pricing for this workshop</b> - <br /><br />2 AAA Batteries needed for the kit - Batteries will not be provided <br />(think of the planet use rechargeables)<br /><br />£10 - Full Drawdio kit to make and keep access to soldering tools and tuition.<br /><br />OR<br /><br />£3 - PCB only, bring your own components and tools<br /><br />OR<br /><br />£2 - Bring your own kit, project and tools. Come along for the experience.<br /><br />There are limited numbers of kits and places on this workshop. <br /><br />Pay on the night as we don't have any prepayment set-up just yet. To help Nottinghack (as we get started) we could use as many soldering irons, wire cutters/strippers, de-solder tools, 3rd hand or blue-tak, and multi-socket adaptors as possible. If you have a bag of components you don't mind sharing bring them too.  <br /><br />Any questions or concerns please email a member of the leadership team.

This venue has parking so if you have a car and items for the BIG Weekender please bring them. We have lots of storage space at this venue. Please DO bring wood off cuts, MDF sheet or hard/chip board. Items of interest. Tripods, frames or anything to add height. We basically need a huge variety of stuff. Please DON'T bring anything that could be considered as undesirable waste.<br />
Dominic on 2010-05-28 @ 22:29<br />

Who would be up for building a major element of the Machine at this session? I've an idea to build the game 'Mouse Trap' life sized. By life sized I mean the boot, hand and bucket are life sized (i.e. real) rather than the bath and the diver. 

Items needed for this:
Bucket, Big laundry basket, heavy ball, planks, PVC pipe, threaded rod, some old work gloves, 'No-Big-Gaps' expanding foam, wooden dowels (all sizes), old drain pipes or guttering etc.

Don't forget to bring something to hack with your Sugru (we'll be providing the Sugru). I'm going to either mod my iPhone case to make it more rugged Grrr! Or I'm going to mod my camera from my Kite Aerial Photography rig... Check www.sugru.com for ideas!

The free parking is somewhere near the Multi York Shop. On the right hand side as you head towards QMC or on the left hand side if you are heading towards the pub. It's about 5 min walk. Michael and I both parked there for the SUGRU night.

This will be Nottingham Hackspace the home of Nottinghack. <br /><br />We don't have anything at all set up yet. We'll be looking for folk to become paid members of the space (with privileges etc) we'll still do the meetup and workshops for free.<br /><br />This meetup is an opportunity to see (the empty) space, find out more about the project and even become a founding member. <br /><br />The Art Org is an ideal space in a great central location. The rent and arrangement we have is very reasonable and can grow with us. As part of the deal with the Landlords we'll be doing a few hours volunteer work at the Art Org, particularly electrical. <br /><br />To find the space look for the green door next to the mini-Tesco on Station Street Nottingham.  <br /><br /><img src='http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/e/9/600_16986889.jpeg' border='0' alt='' /><br /><br /><img src='http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/3/1/event_16986961.jpeg' border='0' alt='' /><br /><br /><br />

About Parking on Sundays 

I think the parking is free (but please check the meters) including right outside the Hackspace.

a large all day car park at the Station on Queens Road just 3 mins walk away

Bike it and use the station's excellent Cycle Hub below the tram bridge

Alternatively use Broadmarsh shopping centre car park.  

We are right next to the station so train is the best way from Mansfield, Derby, Lincoln, Newark etc

We're 30 secs walk from the tram and buses too!<br />
Dominic on 2010-09-20 @ 23:28<br />
<br />
Ah I am looking forward to this!<br />

"General Normal Open Hacking & Tidy Up the Store Room","2010-11-03","18:30","2010-11-03","21:30","false","After having a frankly mad October at the Hackspace with many big ticket events we're going to kick back and tidy the store room. <br /><br />It's an Open hack night. That means bring your own project or simply pop down to do some quiet reading, programming, or just have a good geeky natter and a cuppa. <br /><br />We'll be reviewing the Laser Maze from last week. Might also be scheduling more volunteer electronics for the Art Org. There are plans afoot to move to the 1st floor and there is plenty of very cool things to be done to make that space more hackspace like. <br /><br />Any questions or comments please contact one of the leadership team. <br /><br />Not been before? Just pop down, the first visit is always free &amp; no-one need pay a penny if they don't like it. <br /><br />

Apologies, posted to the wrong social group! I was talking about the Programmers and Dev. group that meets at Notts Contemporary. Turned up a little too early for that group by the looks of things. Also, been thinking of attending a hackerSpace very soon! Hope things will work out better next time for me. Thank you all for being friendly to an old sour puss like myself!<br />

Hi Xander,

Sorry to hear you've had a bad night & are disappointed as a result, however I think there's been a misunderstanding.

The Hackspace is located at:
The Old Police Station, 3 - 9 Station Street, as posted at the top of this meetup. If you have trouble finding it, head for the train station, find the Tesco's opposite & the hackspace is through the green door to the right (photo is above) on the 1st floor (you'll have to buzz to get in though)

I hope to see you at future meets / events<br />
Tony Shannon on 2011-01-19 @ 22:49<br />
<br />
You must have been at the wrong place. Everytime I have been it has been very clearly marked with a large poster and the intercom is marked too. I don't know the city very well but above the tesco next to the train station was easy enough for me to find.<br />
Tony on 2011-01-19 @ 21:53<br />
<br />
I came. Notts Contemporary never heard of 'hackerspace'. I waited 10 minutes, no one turned up. So, I left. THANKS FOR WASTING MY NIGHT.<br />

"How To Workshop: Make a Circuit Board ","2011-01-26","18:30","2011-01-26","21:30","false","Get the basics of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) manufacture from Nottinghack's Matt Little (from our Soldering &amp; Drawdio Workshops). <br /><br />There are many processes and techniques for making a printed circuit board (PCB).<br />In this session Matt will guide you through his process for making PCBs, this involves:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Design of PCB<br /><li>UV photoresist <br /><li>Etch<br /><li>Drill<br /></ul><br /><br />Matt uses a mixture of home-made and bought tools. He will highlight some of the problems and share some of the tips and tricks he's uses.<br /><br />You will get to create and keep a circuit board for a simple LED flashing circuit (components included). <br /><br />The circuit board layout is made using the open source software called KiCad (for both Linux and Windows). If you have a (small) circuit you would like created then bring along your completed PCB design and we can make that with you!<br /><br />This session will cost £8. In this session we will develop and make the circuit board and (if time) you can solder up the circuit to create a simple LED flasher. All tools supplied.<br /><br />Please do tell us about your own PCB manufacture methods<br /><br />Don't want to make a circuit board? It's Open Hack Night so please do come and join us that's FREE as always! Only pay if you take part in the workshop!<br /><br /><br />* Please note the image is NOT the circuit you'll make on this workshop (just a picture)<br /><br />

"Hackers-On-A-BUS - Maker Faire UK 2011 in Newcastle DAY 1","2011-03-12","10:00","2011-03-12","13:00","false","<b>Maker Faire UK Newcastle 2011</b><br /><br />The world-famous Maker Faire returns to the UK to headline Newcastle ScienceFest. Expect a weekend of cool robots, garden-shed inventions, knitted wonders, the occasional fireball and oodles of opportunities to make your own creations. Perfect for creative people of all ages!<br /><br />Maker Faire 2011 is likely to be the biggest yet. Many of the other Hackspaces that have formed in 2010 will be there too. <br /><br /><br /><br />We plan to hire a mini-bus: Rough details from a recent Google Groups email here:<br /><br /><b>Likely costs for Maker Faire Newcastle:</b><br /> <br />I'd anticipate that costs for this trip are going to be about £75/£125 as <br />follows: <br /><br />2x £5 - MAKER FAIRE ENTRY - Based on last years price <br />£12 - SEAT ON BUS - 17 seat Mini Bus Hire - £189 / 17 <br /><a href='http://www.eastmidshire.com/oldqq2.php' target='_blank'>http://www.eastmidshi...</a> <br />£4/£6 - FUEL SHARE -  Share of Based on 330 miles at 30 miles per <br />gallon 11 gallons approx. 50L at avg. £1.20 per Litre <br /><br />£50 - HOTEL - Premier Inn Newcastle South - <br /><a href='http://www.premierinn.com/en/homeQuickSearch!execute.action' target='_blank'>http://www.premierinn...</a> <br />Obviously we can try and tweak this on the hotel cost I just chose the <br />cheapest Premier Inn and haven't looked at other hotels or cheaper B&amp;B <br />options or anything like that. We might even be able to wangle some <br />sort of group booking if we do something about it now. Ideally our <br />hotel needs to have parking, be in Newcastle proper (this one is in <br />Gateshead) be about £30 - £40, ideally walking distance to the venue <br />which is about 2 mins from the station. <br /><br />We'd probably drop you back to your door if you live in Nottingham or <br />there about. <br /><br />The quoted price is for transport. If we get a higher number of interested people we'll try and get a bigger bus. You'll be responsible for your own accommodation, food &amp; ticket entry costs for the faire itself. <br /><br />We'll be asking for a deposit at least 1 month prior to the Faire. You'll need to have paid your deposit by the 12th February 2011 or we'll make your place available to someone else.<br /><br />

Yo, I have booked a 6-bed hostel room in the Albatross (link above) for the nights of the 11th and 12th march. Total for this is around Â£20 per person per night, if there are 6 people, obviously a bit more if there are less than 6...
Hope thats good with everyone - we will get to know each other just that little bit better (maybe too much?...)<br />
